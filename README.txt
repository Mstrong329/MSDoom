This engine uses a portal based system to render rooms.
This makes it more similar to DukeNukem 3d
This site was an excellent resource for learning how the engine runs https://fabiensanglard.net/duke3d/build_engine_internals.php 

However, all of the code was written by me
except for the movement scripts The movement (lines 518-616) 
these come from a YouTube video by 3d sage https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=huMO4VQEwPc
this video a large inspiration for the project and while it's similar, the only code shared is the movement

This project overall took a week to make.

The code is not very clean and I may go back to clean and optimize later but for now this will do.

Instructions: use WASD to move around and <> to strafe.
there is no wall collision yet
